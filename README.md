Rice, which is among the most widely produced grain products worldwide, has many genetic varieties. These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. In this study, Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag, which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey, were used. A total of 75,000 grain images, 15,000 from each of these varieties, are included in the dataset. the developed CNN model showcased promising results in classifying rice varieties based on grain images. It effectively leveraged the distinguishing features of rice, such as texture, shape, and color, to achieve accurate classification. The model's high accuracy and performance metrics indicate its potential for automated and efficient rice variety classification. However, further enhancements are recommended to improve the distinction between specific rice varieties. Overall, this study contributes to the field of automated seed quality evaluation and classification, benefiting the rice industry.
